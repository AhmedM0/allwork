RESEARCH
-----------
1. typically on wireframes we dont have colors or fonts. The wireframes are just to give us an idea of how content will layout. 
2. the sitemap doesn't show WHAT is on a page, just show the pages that are going to exist. 
3. for research, make sure to give me the URL of the sites you found. Also, add a couple more and maybe a bit more depth to what you like or dislike. 
4. missing URL file, please always include that when you hand in your week 4 and 8 projects

CODING
---------
HTML
- Your folder structures seem a bit out of wack. I'm noticing that you have site.css outside of the css folder? make sure not to do that. 
- index.php why do you have an  class="" that is empty on line 12?
- missing alt tags on your HTML images
- inside your header.php you have inline js, that should be in its own js file inside the js folder
- looks like you are also using jquery... where did you get this code?
- about.php you need to continue having proper html indenting
- don't have alt tags with ... in them. 
- where did you get your form validation stuff? I'd like you to show me this

PHP
- In your index.php file you close your </body></html> then you are including your partials/footer.php which then again closes those two tags. This means the tags are already closed when you close them a second time. 
- For your foreach statements please use {} rather than :  end endforeach
- Why on about.php are you including all your sql queries again?
$arrImages = getData("SELECT * FROM photos");
$arrPackageImages = getData("SELECT * FROM packages");
$arrHeroImage = getData("SELECT * FROM hero");
$arrWeddingSlides = getData("SELECT * FROM wedding_slider");

-at the end of family.php you have a bunch of empty line breaks. Those should be removed

Mobile
- on the mobile for the pricing page the boxes dont resize correctly
- where is the URL where I can view the form submissions?
